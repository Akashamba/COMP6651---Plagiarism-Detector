# COMP6651: Plagiarism-Detector
Plagiarism Detector created for the project component of COMP 6651 - Algorithm Design Techniques taught by Prof. Denis Pankratov at Concordia University in Fall 22

Advanced Plagiarism Detection Tool in Python

Developed a sophisticated plagiarism detection tool in Python, employing advanced algorithms to accurately identify text similarities. The tool integrates n-gram tokenization for analyzing local context, cosine similarity for efficient comparison of text vectors, and Levenshtein Distance for in-depth analysis of textual differences. By utilizing a hybrid approach, the tool significantly enhances the accuracy of plagiarism detection.
